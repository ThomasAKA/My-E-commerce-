      <p class="w3-text-grey">Our goal is to create a website that can host several shops selling a variety of products.
The website will allow the shop owners create exclusive accounts, with these accounts the shop owners can enter details of the shop as well as products on offer.
Shop owners can upload product details along with prices, stock and snapshots of products through their accounts.
Customers must also create accounts before they can make purchases. The account will keep track of products viewed and purchased.
Once the customer make payments, the product will be delivered to their doorsteps.
To entice customers to use the Sears Online Mall frequently, we will offer rewards such as free shipping, discounts, and gifts depending on how much they spent and how often they spend on our online mall.
